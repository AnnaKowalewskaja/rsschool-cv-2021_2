## __Experience__
### While studying at the University, we studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, PHP, but these were only small basics. Then I started working as a software engineer and now I can try my skills on a real site _(no one sees it yet)_. I often take free courses on programming and working with image editors.

## __English__
### B1
#### _I'm trying to improve my skill._
### I studied English at school and University. However, I've already forgotten most of it. This summer we went to an English-speaking country and there I was able to practice speaking. Upon arrival, I realized that the language is necessary and bought school textbooks, which I now use to learn English. During the course, I try to use the translator only for unknown words. I make notes from the material in English.
